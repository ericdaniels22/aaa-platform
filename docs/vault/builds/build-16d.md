## What shipped

Invoices, manual payments, and bidirectional sync to QuickBooks. Invoice PDF generation, send/mark-sent/void flow, record-payment modal, sync-log admin UI, pre-launch checklist. Stripe webhook stub planted for [[build-17a]].

- **Migration:** [supabase/migration-build38-invoice-payment-sync.sql](../../../supabase/migration-build38-invoice-payment-sync.sql) — `invoices`, `payments`, invoice/payment columns, triggers, `invoice_email_settings`.
- **Routes:** `/invoices`, `/invoices/new`, `/invoices/[id]`, `/settings/invoices`, `/api/invoices`, `/api/invoices/[id]`, `/api/invoices/[id]/mark-sent`, `/api/invoices/[id]/pdf`, `/api/invoices/[id]/send`, `/api/invoices/[id]/void`, `/api/payments`, `/api/payments/[id]`, `/accounting/sync-log`, `/api/settings/invoice-email`.
- **Sync engine:** advisory-lock processor; invoice/payment/void modules with backoff; manual mark-synced + extended Fix modal (deposit/auth/duplicate classifications).
- **Stripe webhook stub:** signature verification + logging only — actual handler shipped in [[build-17a]]/[[build-17c]].
