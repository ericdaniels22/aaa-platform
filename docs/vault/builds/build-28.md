## What shipped

Rule engine extension for `body_pattern` matches (in addition to sender/subject from [[build-27]]). Required IMAP header re-fetch for backfill since the original IMAP fetch hadn't pulled body text.

- **Migration:** [supabase/migration-build28-body-patterns.sql](../../../supabase/migration-build28-body-patterns.sql).
- **Sync fix later:** `84a5f32 fix(email): pass body_text to sync-time categorizer, restoring Promotions` — sync was passing the wrong field after a refactor.
