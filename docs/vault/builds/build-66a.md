## What shipped

The empty-but-structured `docs/vault/` tree: subfolders for builds, handoffs, decisions, agents, platform-skills, data-sources, plus the always-paste pair (`00-NOW.md`, `00-glossary.md`) and Templater stubs.

- **Layout** (this folder): `agents/`, `builds/`, `data-sources/`, `decisions/`, `handoffs/`, `platform-skills/`, `_templates/`, plus `00-NOW.md`, `00-glossary.md`, `README.md`.
- **Template stubs** in `_templates/` are intentional placeholders; full template bodies land in [[build-66c]] when the `end-of-session-handoff` skill defines the canonical structure.
- **No migration** — docs-only.
