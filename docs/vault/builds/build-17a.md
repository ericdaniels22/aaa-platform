## What shipped

Stripe Connect (Standard) flow: connect/disconnect, signed OAuth state, settings (payment methods, surcharge, ACH threshold). Payment requests via Checkout Sessions with token-based public access; deposit + invoice request modal; encrypted Stripe secret loading.

- **Migration:** [supabase/migration-build39-stripe-payments.sql](../../../supabase/migration-build39-stripe-payments.sql) — `stripe_connection`, `payment_requests`, `stripe_events` (idempotency, partial index for unprocessed); invoice/job flags.
- **Routes:** `/settings/stripe`, `/api/stripe/connect/start`, `/api/stripe/connect/callback`, `/api/stripe/disconnect`, `/api/stripe/settings`, `/api/payment-requests`, `/api/payment-requests/[id]`, `/api/payment-requests/[id]/void`.
- **Helpers:** Stripe client wrapper, signed OAuth state helper, payment-link JWT helper (reuses `SIGNING_LINK_SECRET` from contracts).
- Libraries added: `stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`.
