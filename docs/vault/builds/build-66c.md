## What's planned

Authoring the Claude Code skills that keep the vault current without willpower:

- `end-of-session-handoff` (also `/handoff`) — writes a dated handoff and updates `00-NOW.md` at session end.
- `start-of-session-orientation` (also `/orient`) — reads the vault and gives a one-paragraph briefing at session start.
- Templater stub bodies in `_templates/` filled in with the canonical structures these skills produce.
