## What's shipping

Audit-first backfill of the vault content from repo evidence (migrations, routes, code, commits, plan files, handoff documents) — no card written from training, memory, or guide-doc summary alone. Produces:

- One build card per shipped build under `builds/`.
- Per-session handoff entries under `handoffs/` (preserving session-a / session-b / session-c distinctions for builds 18a/b/c).
- Data-source cards for the heavy-hitter Supabase tables.
- The Jarvis agent card under `agents/jarvis.md` with platform-skill spinoffs under `platform-skills/`.
- Decisions backfill (Nookleus rename, build52 NULL-tokens lesson, others as evidence surfaces).
- Refreshed `00-NOW.md` with the corrected major-systems inventory and the "Last verified against repo" date bumped.

The non-negotiable discipline: every claim is repo-grounded. The four guide docx files (v1.3/1.4/1.6/1.7) cover specs through Build 17 only — anything later is read off the codebase.
