## What shipped

A latent regression fix: the `on_auth_user_created` trigger on `auth.users` had been silently absent (the function `public.handle_new_user()` survived [[build-18a]] build48's rewrite, but the trigger calling it was dropped at some point). Surfaced during [[build-18c]] Session C as a `user_organizations_user_id_profile_fkey` FK violation when inviting a new user via `/settings/users`.

The fix is one idempotent `CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER` plus deletion of one orphaned `auth.users` row (`eric@testtesttest.com`) left over from the failed invite. **Zero application code changes.**
