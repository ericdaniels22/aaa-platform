## Project state and continuity

Before starting work, read:

- [docs/vault/00-NOW.md](docs/vault/00-NOW.md) — current state of the platform
- [docs/vault/00-glossary.md](docs/vault/00-glossary.md) — names and terms

If anything in your training, memory, or default knowledge contradicts
`00-NOW.md`, defer to the file. Memory drifts; the file is ground truth.

When wrapping up a session, run the `/handoff` slash command (or invoke
the `end-of-session-handoff` skill) to update the vault. _(The skill
itself ships in Build 66c; until then update `00-NOW.md` by hand.)_

The Obsidian vault root is the repo root itself, not `docs/vault/`. So
`.claude/skills/` and `.claude/commands/` are also editable from the
same Obsidian window. Curated knowledge content lives under
`docs/vault/`; the wider scope is for editor convenience.
